Figure out how to decouple the photo_upload URL path from the ziplookup path.  IE I don't want to have the URL in the ajax call for ziplookup include "photo" in it.  I guess this isn't really a big deal as long as I explain the URL HAS TO BE      

url(r'^photo/', include('photo_upload.urls'))


Figure out what this means when I try to submit:

MultiPartParserError at /photo/bla-bla-bla/submit
Invalid boundary in multipart: NoneRequest Method: POSTRequest URL: 
Probably means I need to set up a boundary... though I didn't before so...
