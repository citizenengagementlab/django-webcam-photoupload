Webcam Photo Upload
===========

Written mostly by Mike Vattuone at Citizen Engagement Laboratory, with support from Josh Levinger.

This webcam photo upload tool provides a tool for people to upload a picture of themselves, just as they are reading and learning about your campaign, and share their support or opposition to a cause or person.  

Installation
=========

Pretty dang simple:

* Add 'photo_upload' to your INSTALLED_APPS.

* Include photo_upload.urls in your main URL.

* ...?  Not really sure what you'll have to do to make this work nicely, quite yet... 

A caveat
-------------

Sooo we're still kind of figuring out how to organize this bad boy, so any and all suggestions to the structure of the project would be more than welcome.  :)
